# Getting Started: Your Guide to This Library

Welcome! You've arrived at the most comprehensive Databricks resource available. The sheer volume of information here can be overwhelming, so this guide provides a clear, opinionated path to help you get the most out of this library.

## I'm a... 

### ...Data Engineer

Your world is about building robust, scalable, and reliable data pipelines. Here's your path:

1.  **Start with the Foundation**: Master the **[Medallion Architecture](pillar_i/medallion_architecture/)** in Pillar I. This is the core pattern for data engineering on Databricks.
2.  **Master Your Tools**: Dive deep into the **[Python & PySpark](pillar_ii/python_pyspark/)** and **[Databricks SQL](pillar_ii/databricks_sql/)** sections in Pillar II.
3.  **Build a Pipeline**: Work through the **[Streaming ETL with DLT](cookbooks/streaming_etl/)** cookbook. This is your blueprint for production pipelines.
4.  **Automate Everything**: Study the **[CI/CD with GitHub Actions](cookbooks/cicd/)** cookbook and the **[CLI & REST API Automation](cookbooks/cli_and_api_automation/)** cookbook.

### ...Data Scientist

Your focus is on deriving insights and building models from data. Here's your path:

1.  **Understand the Data**: Get familiar with how data is organized by reviewing **[Pillar I: The Databricks Universe](pillar_i/)**.
2.  **Explore and Analyze**: The **[Python & PySpark](pillar_ii/python_pyspark/)** section is your primary toolkit. Pay special attention to DataFrame manipulations.
3.  **Train Your Models**: The **[ML Model Training with MLflow](cookbooks/ml_training/)** cookbook is your end-to-end guide for the machine learning lifecycle.
4.  **Go Advanced**: Explore the **[Graph Analytics](cookbooks/graph_analytics/)** and **[Unstructured Data](cookbooks/unstructured_data/)** cookbooks for more advanced use cases.

### ...Data Analyst / BI Developer

You bridge the gap between data and business value. Here's your path:

1.  **Speak the Language**: Master **[Databricks SQL](pillar_ii/databricks_sql/)**. This is your primary interface for querying the lakehouse.
2.  **Connect Your Tools**: The **[Power BI Integration](cookbooks/power_bi_integration/)** cookbook is your essential guide. Also, review the **[JDBC Connections](cookbooks/jdbc_connections/)** cookbook for connecting to other data sources.
3.  **Understand the Architecture**: Knowing how data flows through the **[Medallion Architecture](pillar_i/medallion_architecture/)** will help you understand where to find the data you need.

### ...Data Architect / Platform Owner

You are responsible for the big picture. Here's your path:

1.  **Start with Strategy**: **[Pillar V: Architectural Patterns](pillar_v_architectural_patterns/)** is your home base. Understand how to design a Data Mesh and other large-scale patterns.
2.  **Govern Your Platform**: The **[Unity Catalog Deep Dive](cookbooks/unity_catalog_deep_dive/)** and **[Security](cookbooks/security/)** cookbooks are critical for building a secure and well-governed platform.
3.  **Enable Your Teams**: Review the **[CI/CD](cookbooks/cicd/)** and **[CLI & API Automation](cookbooks/cli_and_api_automation/)** cookbooks to understand how to build a self-serve platform.
4.  **Share Securely**: The **[Delta Sharing](cookbooks/delta_sharing/)** cookbook will show you how to securely share data with external partners.
