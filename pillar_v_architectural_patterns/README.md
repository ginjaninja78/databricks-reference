# Pillar V: Architectural Patterns

Welcome to the fifth pillar of the Databricks Reference Library. This section moves beyond individual features and cookbooks to explore high-level architectural patterns for designing, building, and managing modern data platforms on Databricks.

Understanding these patterns is crucial for data architects, platform owners, and senior engineers responsible for the strategic design of their organization's data ecosystem.

## 🏛️ Architectural Blueprints

This pillar provides detailed blueprints and discussions on key architectural concepts:

- **[Data Mesh on Databricks](data_mesh.md)**: A deep dive into implementing the principles of Data Mesh (domain ownership, data as a product, self-serve platform, and federated governance) within the Databricks Lakehouse.
- **[Lambda & Kappa Architectures](lambda_and_kappa.md)**: An exploration of how these classic data processing architectures are realized and simplified in the context of the modern data lakehouse.
- **[Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Deployments](multi_cloud.md)**: Strategies and best practices for deploying and managing Databricks across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and in hybrid scenarios.

*This pillar provides the strategic "why" behind the technical "how" detailed in the rest of this repository. It is designed to guide your long-term architectural decisions.*
