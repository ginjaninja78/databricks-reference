# Data Governance & Security: Building a Trusted Lakehouse

As organizations centralize their data within the Databricks Lakehouse, establishing a robust framework for **data governance and security** becomes paramount. It's not enough to simply store data; you must ensure it is discoverable, reliable, secure, and compliant with regulations.

Databricks provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to manage and govern the entire data and AI lifecycle. This unified approach to governance simplifies administration and provides a consistent security model across all data assets, from raw tables to machine learning models.

This section explores the key components of the Databricks governance model, focusing on the tools and best practices required to build a secure, compliant, and trusted data platform.

Key topics covered include:

*   **Unity Catalog**: The cornerstone of Databricks governance, providing a unified governance solution for all data and AI assets.
*   **Table Access Control**: A deep dive into the fine-grained permissions model for securing access to tables, views, rows, and columns.
*   **Data Lineage**: Understanding how to automatically track and visualize the flow of data from source to consumption, providing critical auditability and impact analysis.

Mastering these concepts is essential for any developer or administrator responsible for managing an enterprise-grade Databricks deployment.
