# BI & Visualization Integration

The ultimate goal of most data pipelines is to deliver insights to business users. Business Intelligence (BI) and visualization tools are the primary interface for this consumption. Ensuring a seamless, performant, and secure connection between your Databricks Lakehouse and your BI platform is therefore a critical aspect of enterprise readiness.

We will cover:

*   **Connectivity Modes**: Understanding the different ways to connect Power BI to Databricks (Import, DirectQuery) and the trade-offs of each.
*   **Architectural Best Practices**: How to design your Gold layer in Databricks for optimal performance with BI tools.
*   **Authentication and Security**: How to securely manage credentials and enforce a consistent security model between Databricks and your BI platform.
