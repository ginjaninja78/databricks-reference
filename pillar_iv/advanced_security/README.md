# Advanced Security & Networking

While Unity Catalog provides excellent fine-grained control over data access, enterprise readiness often requires a more comprehensive security posture that integrates with your corporate security standards and network architecture. This section dives into the advanced security and networking features that allow you to lock down your Databricks environment and ensure it complies with the strictest security requirements.

We will cover two critical areas:

1.  **Secrets Management**: How to securely store and access secrets like API keys, database passwords, and connection strings without ever hardcoding them in your notebooks.

2.  **Network Security**: How to isolate your Databricks workspace from the public internet and integrate it securely within your own virtual network (VNet).
