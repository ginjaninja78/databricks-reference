# Cost & Performance Optimization

In a cloud environment, performance and cost are two sides of the same coin. An inefficient pipeline is not just slow; it's expensive. A key responsibility for any enterprise data team is to ensure that the platform is delivering maximum value for its cost. This requires a proactive approach to monitoring, managing, and optimizing your Databricks usage.

This section provides strategies and best practices for managing the cost and performance of your Databricks environment at a macro level. We will cover:

1.  **Cluster Management Strategies**: How to choose the right cluster types and configurations for your workloads to balance performance and cost.

2.  **Cost Attribution and Monitoring**: How to use Databricks tools and tags to monitor your spending, attribute costs back to specific teams or projects, and identify areas for optimization.
