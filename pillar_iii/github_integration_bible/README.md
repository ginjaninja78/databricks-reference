# The GitHub Integration Bible

Welcome to the definitive guide for integrating Databricks with GitHub. In modern data teams, code is code, whether it's a Python library, a SQL script, or a Databricks notebook. Treating your data and AI assets with the same rigor as application code is the hallmark of a mature DataOps/MLOps practice.

This bible provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough of every facet of the Databricks-GitHub integration. Our goal is to take you from zero to hero, enabling you to build a robust, automated, and collaborative development lifecycle on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform.

We will cover three key levels of integration:

1.  **Level 1: Version Control with Databricks Repos**: The foundational step. Learn how to connect your Databricks workspace to a GitHub repository to enable version control, branching, and collaborative development directly within the Databricks UI.

2.  **Level 2: Automation with CI/CD & GitHub Actions**: The heart of DevOps. Learn how to build automated pipelines that test and deploy your code (notebooks, libraries, DLT pipelines) when you merge changes in GitHub. This is where you achieve true automation and repeatability.

3.  **Level 3: Advanced CI/CD Patterns**: Go beyond the basics and learn enterprise-grade patterns for managing complex deployments, such as multi-environment promotion (dev -> staging -> prod), secrets management, and infrastructure as code for your Databricks jobs and clusters.

This is an exhaustive resource. By the end of this section, you will have the knowledge and the code templates to implement a professional-grade DevOps lifecycle for your Databricks projects.
